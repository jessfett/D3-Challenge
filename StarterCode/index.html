          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity and Income</h2>
          <p>The scatterplot above outlines a correlation between the state-wide average income and the state-wide obesity percentage. The 
            data visualized above shows a strong, negative correlation.  The scatterplot allows us to recognize the pattern that
            based off of the provided information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 
            the higher a state's average yearly income, the lower the states obesity percentage.           </p>

          <p>To breakdown the data to a few select examples that highlight this trend, we will look at Washington D.C. and Arkansas.  
            Washington D.C. has the second highest income, $71,648, and the lowest obesity percentage, 21.7%. Arkansas has 
            the third lowest average yearly income, $41,262, and the highest obesity percentage at 35.9%. With all correlations, there's exceptions. Taking a look at Maryland, which is a state with the highest yearly income
            at $73,971, you can note that the obesity percentage is actually in the middle of all 50 states at 29.6%. 
          </p>

          <p>The deeper investigation of this observation, if higher income results in lower obesity, could investigate
            further in to the spending trends of each state. If someone has a higher income are they able to buy healthier,
            yet more expensive, food? Does someone with lower income look for a quick, cheap meal resulting in eating
            take out and fast food more often?  Does higher income correlate with a lifestyle that allows for higher 
            end quality of activities - better gyms, athletics, at home training? Overall, from the data provided by the U.S.
            Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we are able to observe that regardless of 
            the deeper reasoning, states with higher average yearly income do tend to have lower obesity throughout their population.
